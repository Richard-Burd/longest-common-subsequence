# Longest Common Subsequence
A program to find the longest common subsequence (LCS) of two strings using JSON

## Task & Purpose
The longest common subsequence (LCS) is an intriguing problem that has fascinated me for a while now; I am experimenting with visual aids to try & see if I can some up with a solution to this problem on my own.&nbsp;  I will be trying to replicate the functionality of the algorithm [here](//%20https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Longest_common_subsequence#JavaScript) that is labeled "**Dynamic Programming**."

## Cool Graphics
Here is a rough-draft sketch of what I've been working with so far:

## Notes to Self on GitHub Problems
GitHub is acting funny lately; It looks like I must first create an empty repo online, then clone that empty repo to my local environment without first having created a README or description on the web browser interface.  I think it is relate to this change here because if I follow the process above I end up creating a new repo where I start out in the `(master)` branch whereas if I create a README file or repo description first, then when I clone the repo I see I am inside the  `(main)` branch, and then when I go to push I get an error that says `src refspec master does not match any.
